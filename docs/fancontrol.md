# Thorch Fan Curve Quick Guide

Thorch controls the Thor fan with `thorch-fancontrol`. The service reads
temperatures from thermal sysfs sensors, chooses a PWM value from the configured
profile, and writes that value to the fan PWM sysfs node.

For a quieter or more aggressive curve, start with the built-in profiles:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^THORCH_FAN_PROFILE=.*/THORCH_FAN_PROFILE=quiet/' /etc/thorch/fancontrol.conf
sudo systemctl restart thorch-fancontrol.service
sudo thorch-fancontrol status
```

`THORCH_FAN_PROFILE` can be:

- `quiet`: later fan ramp, lower noise.
- `moderate`: balanced default.
- `aggressive`: earlier fan ramp.
- `custom`: user-defined temperature thresholds and PWM speeds.

## Custom Curve

Persistent settings live in `/etc/thorch/fancontrol.conf`. Temperatures are in
millidegrees Celsius, so `65000` means 65 C. PWM speeds are integers from `0` to
`255`.

Edit the config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/thorch/fancontrol.conf
```

Example custom curve:

```bash
THORCH_FAN_PROFILE=custom
THORCH_FAN_POLL_SECONDS=3

THORCH_FAN_T1=50000
THORCH_FAN_T2=55000
THORCH_FAN_T3=60000
THORCH_FAN_T4=65000
THORCH_FAN_T5=70000
THORCH_FAN_T6=75000
THORCH_FAN_MAX_TEMP=80000

THORCH_FAN_SPEED1=51
THORCH_FAN_SPEED2=77
THORCH_FAN_SPEED3=102
THORCH_FAN_SPEED4=119
THORCH_FAN_SPEED5=153
THORCH_FAN_SPEED6=204
THORCH_FAN_MAX_SPEED=255
```

Then restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart thorch-fancontrol.service
sudo thorch-fancontrol status
```

The fan uses the first speed whose threshold has been crossed. For example,
with the custom curve above:

- At or below 50 C, the target PWM is `0`.
- Above 50 C, the target PWM is `51`.
- Above 60 C, the target PWM is `102`.
- Above 80 C, the target PWM is `255`.

Thresholds must increase from `THORCH_FAN_T1` through
`THORCH_FAN_MAX_TEMP`. Speeds may stay flat or increase, but values outside
`0..255` are rejected.

## Testing

Check the detected PWM path, selected sensors, current averaged temperature, and
target PWM:

```bash
sudo thorch-fancontrol status
```

Apply the current curve once without leaving a daemon running:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop thorch-fancontrol.service
sudo thorch-fancontrol once
```

Start the normal boot service again:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now thorch-fancontrol.service
```

Follow service logs while tuning:

```bash
journalctl -fu thorch-fancontrol.service
```

## Sensor And PWM Overrides

Most users should leave hardware paths empty so Thorch can autodetect them. For
bring-up or debugging, the config can pin paths explicitly:

```bash
THORCH_FAN_PWM_PATH=/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1
THORCH_FAN_TEMP_SENSORS="/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp"
```

`THORCH_FAN_TEMP_SENSORS` is a space-separated list. When more than one sensor
is configured, Thorch averages the readable values before selecting the fan
speed.

## Safety Notes

Lower-noise curves also mean higher temperatures. Keep a terminal open with
`thorch-fancontrol status` or `journalctl -fu thorch-fancontrol.service` while
tuning, and avoid disabling the service for normal use.

If a custom curve fails validation, `thorch-fancontrol` exits without applying
it. Fix `/etc/thorch/fancontrol.conf`, then restart the service.
